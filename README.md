## Insider threats
Files
* GA_kNN.py : the file to generate attacks using GA and kNN as fitness (individuals as feature vectors)
* kNN.py : Process the data by user to create "sessions". One session begins with the first action made by one user one day and ends with the last action he did on that day. One session is represented by a feature vector. It uses an Unsupervised kNN to calculate the distance between each session.
* GA_dist.py : generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 13. Each number represent an action. It then simulates several runs of GA to create sequences that look like one of the anomalous scenarios. It uses the Cosine distance as fitness function (Damerau-Levenshtein is too slow)
* csv_splitter.py : splits the dataset into smaller files
* users.py : it combines the actions from the splitted data into a csv file by user. These files contains all of the actions by one user
* GP_attack.py : Uses GP to generate functions that creates sequences of anomalous actions. They are evaluated using the DL distance and compared with the attacks from the dataset.

Examples of individuals generated by the first version of attack.py (these individuals are not used for now)
